Tool for brute forcing BIP39 seed phrases for ETH wallets

Code was forked from the pierce403 user that did bip39brute. It kinda didn't worked as i wished so i forked a lot of things over there to make it work on my Ubuntu system.

Some useful resources:

Could use some threading if intended for serious use :-)

Tweet @CryptoPotato74 on twitter if you find this helpful or to demand improvements. To my knowledge it hasn't actually cracked anything useful yet, but it really works as i tested the seed phrase with actual funds on two wallets of it.
